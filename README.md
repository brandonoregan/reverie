The backend of our project is powered by Python and Django, leveraging Django REST Framework (DRF) for its robust API capabilities, which is seamlessly consumed by our React frontend for dynamic interactions. PostgreSQL was chosen for its smooth integration with Django, ensuring efficient data handling. On the frontend, we combined React's interactive UI capabilities with Redux for state management, and React Bootstrap for responsive design, creating a cohesive and engaging user experience.
