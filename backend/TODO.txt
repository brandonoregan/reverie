FIXBUG: The refresh token is needed to succesfully logout and add to token black list. So when the token expires naturally and the user hits logout it fails and the local storage isn't cleared. 
HOW: Implement logout timer or figure timer at refresh_token expiration
WORK AROUND: Increased lifespan of tokens in settings.

FIXBUG: When user logs out cartItems are removed but the redux state isn't updated until there is a refresh so the items are still visible in the cart page and on the cart icon.
